                                 In the mean time, started his research in crystallography

                                bacteriology, along with 
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Cohn" target="_blank">Ferdinand Cohn</a> and

                                He is also regarded as the "father of microbiology".
                            </li>

                                happens because of living organisms.

                            <li>Fermentation by living organisms were said to had been studied 
                                by Charles Cagniard-Latour, Friedrich Traugott Kützing and Theodor Schwann in the 
                                1930s, before Louis Pasteur findings.

                            <li>Publicization of Pasteur's laboratory notes reveals that his anthrax vaccines
                                use a large amount of work from

                                Pasteur did not mention in his final work.

                            <li><em>Experimental ethics</em>: Many of Pasteur's works and procedures were 
                                under critism. He practiced medical experienments even though he did not have 
                                a medical license. Pasteur's procedures were also under questions because he 
                                always kept them secret. It is later revealed that Pasture did not use proper
                                pre-clinical trials on animals before testing the rabies vaccines a human.
